Installation
************

.. Attention::

   If you've deployed a local instance of the Wizard (Docker or build from source), we kindly request you to fill out this `DS Wizard instance registration <https://goo.gl/forms/9U4qoX25t1i6dcCo1>`_.

Public Instance
===============

The application is currently deployed on a server provided by `FIT CTU <https://fit.cvut.cz/en>`_. Here are the addresses of running applications:

- Landing: https://ds-wizard.org
- Server: https://api.app.ds-wizard.org
- Client: https://app.ds-wizard.org

.. Tip::

   You are free to register and test out the Wizard within the `ds-wizard.org <https://ds-wizard.org>`_. Then you can decide if you want a local instance for you or your organization.


.. _installation-docker:

Via Docker
==========

The simplest way is to use `Docker Compose <https://docs.docker.com/compose/>`_. Requirements are just to have Docker installed, privileges for current user and the Docker daemon started.

1. Create a folder (e.g.,  ``/dsw``, all commands in this manual are from this working directory)  
2. Prepare all config files described in :ref:`Configuration` (especially, ``application.yml`` and ``worker-config.json``), paths are visible from the :ref:`docker-compose.yml`
3. Copy (and adjust) :ref:`docker-compose.yml` provided below
4. Run the DSW with Docker compose ``docker-compose up -d``
5. After starting up, you will be able to open the Wizard in your browser on http://localhost
6. You can use ``docker-compose logs`` to see the logs and ``docker-compose down`` to stop all the services

.. _docker-compose.yml:

.. literalinclude:: docker-compose.yml

   :language: yaml

.. Tip::

   You can take a look at https://github.com/ds-wizard/dsw-deployment-example

Upgrade
-------

.. Warning::

   Backup database and other imporant data (e.g., configuration) before upgrade!

In case of using Docker, just use the tag in :ref:`docker-compose.yml` or pull the new Docker image and restart using down/up:

.. code-block:: shell

   $ docker pull datastewardshipwizard/server
   $ docker pull datastewardshipwizard/client
   $ docker pull datastewardshipwizard/crontab
   $ docker-compose down
   $ docker-compose up -d


Locally without Docker
======================

We highly recommend using Docker, but you are open to compile and run everything directly on your device. It is tested on Ubuntu 16.04 and you might encounter problems when using other plaforms and Linux distributions.

General Requirements
--------------------

- `The Haskell tool Stack <https://docs.haskellstack.org>`_ (for server side)
- `NPM <https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm>`_ (for client side)
- `MongoDB <https://www.mongodb.com>`_ (database, needs to be running)
- `RabbitMQ <https://www.rabbitmq.com>`_ (optional, based on your :ref:`configuration`)
- `wkhtmltopdf <https://github.com/wkhtmltopdf/wkhtmltopdf/releases>`_ (>= 0.12.5, for DMP exports in PDF)
- `Pandoc <https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/releases>`_ (>= 2.6, for DMP exports in other formats aside HTML, PDF, and JSON)

Server
------

1. Get the server app (dsw-server)

   ``git clone git@github.com:ds-wizard/dsw-server.git``

2. Copy and edit configuration (see :ref:`configuration`)

   ``cp config/app-config.cfg.example config/app-config.cfg``

3. Build (takes a lot of time, downloads & builds all dependencies)

   ``stack build``

4. Run (requires MongoDB and RabbitMQ according to configuration)

   ``stack exec dsw-server``

Client
------

1. Get the client app (dsw-client)

   ``git clone git@github.com:ds-wizard/dsw-client.git``

2. Install the app (dependencies)

   ``npm install``

3. Change configuration if the server is not running on http://localhost:3000 (see :ref:`configuration`)
4. Run the app

   ``npm start``

5. Open app in your favorite browser
6. For minified production-ready version, use

   ``npm run build``

Upgrade
-------

.. Warning::

   Backup database and other imporant data (e.g., configuration) before upgrade!

All you need to do is download or checkout new version from our repositories and rebuild the application (according to guidelines above):

.. code-block:: shell

   $ git checkout vX.Y.Z

Default Users
=============

Initially, migrations will fill the database with predefined data needed including three users, all with password "password":

* albert.einstein@example.com (:ref:`usage-administrator`)
* nikola.tesla@example.com (:ref:`usage-datasteward`)
* isaac.newton@example.com (:ref:`usage-researcher`)

You can use those accounts for testing or to initially made your own account admin and then delete them.

.. DANGER::

   Having public instance with default accounts is a **security risk**. Delete or change default accounts (mainly Albert Einstein) if your DSW instance is public as soon as possible.

Other "Setups"
==============

Initial Knowledge Model
-----------------------

When you have a fresh installation, there are just the default users and no knowledge models. You are free to create a new one from scratch if you want. Other option is to download ``elixir-root.km`` file from `ds-wizard/km-elixir-root <https://github.com/ds-wizard/km-elixir-root>`_ and import it (see :ref:`usage`). It is the core knowledge model for general data stewardship.

Public Questionnaire
--------------------

If you also need to enable public questionnaire for :guilabel:`Questionnaire demo` functionality with this core knowledge model, you have to download `public-package-root-1.0.0.json` file below and import it directly to the database into `publicPackages` collection. Optionally, you can move some of your packages similarly.

:download:`public-package-root-1.0.0.json <public-package-root-1.0.0.json>`

.. code-block:: shell

   $ mongoimport --db dsw-server \ 
                 --collection publicPackages \
                 --file public-package-root-1.0.0.json

(If using Docker, you will need `docker exec <https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/exec/>`_.)


.. Note::

   For public questionnaire correctly running, you need to import the related Knowledge Model in the Wizard otherwise you will end up with ``Entity does not exist`` error.

Database Backup
---------------

If you want to regularly backup your database (and you should!), all you need to do is to set-up simple script as cronjob:

.. literalinclude:: dsw-backup.sh
   :caption: dsw-backup.sh
   :language: shell
   :linenos:

Make it executable (chmod a+x dsw-backup.sh) and add it as cronjob with crontab -e:

.. code-block::

   0 4 * * * /dsw/dsw-backup.sh

(This will do the backup every day at 4:00 AM. For more information, see `crontab.guru <https://crontab.guru/>`_.)
