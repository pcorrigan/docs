What is DSW?
============

Data Stewardship Wizard is a joint `ELIXIR CZ <https://www.elixir-czech.cz>`_ and `ELIXIR NL <https://www.dtls.nl/elixir-nl/>`_ project bringing a simple but powerful solution for researchers to help them understand what is needed for good, FAIR-oriented Data Stewardship, to find ELIXIR experts to help out, and to build their own Data Management Plans. The DS Wizard can also function as a check list for data management professionals, like the checklists used by pilots before each flight.

FAIR
----

The main driver for the DSW is now to offer a convenient helpful tool for data stewards and researchers. Given a limited funding, we focus on this mission now. Howevever, from a long-term perspective, the richness of knowledge contained in the Wizard definitively calls for being FAIR. On this page we track the progress of compliance with the `FAIR principles <https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/>`_.

Machine-Actionable DMPs
-----------------------

We are part of the initiative `#activeDMPs <https://activedmps.org>`_. Here, we will post updates on concrete steps, mostly with the respect to the identified use cases. The work on this front will continue according to our available capacity and funding.
